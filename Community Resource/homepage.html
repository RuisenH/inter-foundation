Since joining the firm, she has been involved in a number of design practices and studies for local shopping center interiors.

        <h1>How she practices</h1>
        <p>"If you are studying film, you should watch more movies, and if you are studying jewelry, you should go to jewelry stores more often. After drawing some inspiration, set up a simple framework for your design or project, and keep filling in content and details on the basis of this framework. Finally, with constant revisions and iterations, we will be able to come up with a finished product."</p>

        <h1>Neo-Asian style </h1>
    	</a>
        <p>We discuss Chengdu's iconic commercial complex, Taikoo Li Pedestrian Street, and how the complex combines traditional culture with modern design, religion with commerce. Scarlett sees Taikoo Li pedestrian street as a very typical neo-Asian style building that combines many features of oriental architectural styles.</p>

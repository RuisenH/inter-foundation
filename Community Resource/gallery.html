    <p>East Asian countries have large populations and high population density. The urban population of Asia was 229 million in 1950, roughly the same as the rest of the world. However, six decades later this value had increased sevenfold to over 1.7 billion in 2010. Asian cities have been at the heart of growth and expansion. Between 1950 and 2000, eight of the world's ten fastest-growing cities were in Asia: Tokyo, Mumbai, Delhi, Dhaka, Jakarta, Karachi, Seoul and Kolkata. Half of the world's urban population is now living in Asian cities. These urbanization trends are destined to continue in the coming decades. Between 2010 and 2050, Asia's urban population is expected to double to 3.4 billion people. </p>

Neo-Asian style architecture is a kind of architecture that integrates Asian elements into the modern architecture system, symmetrically using the traditional mood and modern style, using modern design as a metaphor for regional traditions, focusing on the comfort of modern life while allowing the traditional Asian culture to be inherited and carried forward. The essence of the new Asian style is "Eastern culture, Western techniques‚Äù.</p>
